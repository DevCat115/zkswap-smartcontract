Many thanks to Matter Labs and zkSync team for their outstanding contributions to Layer2 ecosystem and ZK-Rollup technology. Based on their open source work, ZKSwap added a swap circuit and a high performance Layer2 zk proving system (using over100 high performance servers and 200 piece 2080Ti GPU Cards, and as far as we know, it's the fastest zk proving system in the market.ï¼‰Thanks for your support to ZKSwap, we will open source the zk circuit code once the final audit is complete.
